Although naval architects never assert that a ship is unsinkable, the sinking of the passenger and car ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea was unexpected, as it was well designed, properly maintained, and had undergone a thorough inspection on the day of its fatal voyage. The ship was equipped with the appropriate number of lifeboats, yet it capsized and sank during a cold, stormy night, resulting in a high death toll of 912 individuals. Most of those on board, particularly women, children, and the elderly, were unable to save themselves as the ship sank rapidly, and they succumbed to hypothermia before being rescued. Despite the tragic incident, there were numerous inquiries about why the Estonia sank and why many of the survivors were healthy men while the majority of the deceased were vulnerable individuals.
